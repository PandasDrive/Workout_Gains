          "cardio": "This is our second back workout on my 12-Week Lean Muscle Program . You'll perform cardio upon waking before you get to the gym, that is if you train later in the day, but if you train early, hit back and then do your first cardio immediately following. That will help transport nutrients to your legs, which should be sore from yesterday's workout. It also gets your blood flowing and supports burning body fat. You'll keep this cardio session to 20 minutes of steady state this week. Then you'll perform another 20-minute session at the end of the day.",

But you can train before your morning cardio, mid-morning, mid-afternoon, after work, or before bed (as long as your p.m. cardio follows). The key is to choose the time that suits your lifestyle best, and make sure you get in every workout. For instance, if you're training in the morning but you're forced to miss a morning workout, you can easily get it in before bedtime. When you miss the time of day when you typically train you can always make it up later-never allow yourself the excuse that you're \"too busy\" to work out.",
