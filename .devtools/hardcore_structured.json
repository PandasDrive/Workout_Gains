        "It's day one and I'm up at around 5:30 a.m., ready to get my breakfast down and head to the gym for my first cardio session of the day. But first, I need to tell you what my weight was this morning...I was sitting at 224.6 lbs. What are you weighing in at? Let's see where we end up in 8 weeks' time. When you're driving to the gym, try and listen to some hard-hitting music or any type of music that gets your head in the right state of mind so you'll be ready to attack the weights with maximum effort. I like to listen to music like Korn on my way to the gym as I imagine taking myself through sets of my upcoming workout with crazy intensity. Let me know what music you guys listen to. I'm always looking for new tracks. Everybody has the same opportunity to start this program, just as we all have our own obstacles to deal with. The real difference lies within your own action, and this depends on how committed you are to your goals. On the first day, you're bound to be motivated, but I need you to carry that on through this whole transformation. Tag me on your socials with #HardcoreTrainer2 and let me know where you are at so I can hold you accountable.",

        "Today is the first active recovery day of the program. I watched KAGED MUSCLE athlete Jesse Norris compete in a local strongman competition which, of course, he won. Jesse is the world's strongest pound-for-pound powerlifter and just an incredible all-around athlete. Besides this, I've taken some time out to relax with friends while remaining in control of my diet, not allowing others around me to influence what I eat. This is something you're going to need to do as well throughout this trainer because there will always be temptation and excuses; don't succumb to them! Don't see weekends as a time where it all stops because your meals, supplements and hydration always need to remain at the forefront of your mind.",
        "Relaxation is actually a very important part of a healthy lifestyle because it helps lower your cortisol levels, which is your stress hormone. Having chronically elevated cortisol levels can make you more vulnerable to serious illnesses like cancer and heart problems. Cortisol can also catabolize muscle tissue and make losing fat a lot harder, so always make time to relax.",

Time will pass you by quickly and you'll only live to regret any inaction that you justify at the end.",

This should awaken your mind to the fact that time passes so quickly, which is why you need to remain in control of your daily actions. Every workout has to surpass the last one; leave nothing to chance here. Missing your supplements for a day, or even one meal can knock you back. We've got another lower back, hamstrings and upper abs workout ahead of us today. Usually we hit lower back first, however, the pump which you get from this means that it can negate from your hamstring workout. For this reason, we're starting with hamstrings first today. How are you finding the increase in cardio this week? Let me know by tagging me on your socials using #HardcoreTrainer2."

You might think doing things like this is going to be impossible while on a training program like this, but it's not! Like I keep saying, all you have to do is remain in control of your environment, which in this case means packing the necessary cooking equipment and food to prepare. For breakfast I cooked up some potatoes, steak, egg whites and mushrooms, which I thoroughly enjoyed.",

While at the top, I enjoyed a ready prepared Ezekiel bread sandwich with steak, peppers and salad. Again, this is here to illustrate to you that this program is all about planning ahead!

        "It's judgment day again! Last Monday I weighed in at 217.8 lbs, however, this morning I've come in at 215.6 lbs. That's a very pleasing drop this far into the transformation for me. Your nutrition plan will remain the same in terms of the ratios I've set for you at the beginning of this program. Having said that, you will need to make some adjustments. Your weight will have come down which means your portions will also need to decrease, in order to reflect this.",
        "Now we're officially halfway through this groundbreaking program, it's time to refocus for the second half. You might be feeling more tired as am I, but now is not the time to start feeling sorry for yourself. This is where the results start to come thick and fast, so persevere in the face of sacrifice!",
        "To mix things up further for week 4, we are going to do everything unilaterally. This means every set purely isolates one side of your body, whether that's your biceps, lat or quad. The principle is to forge a better mind to muscle connection, burn more calories and shock the system.",
        "We're putting up cardio to 35 minutes per session now, to increase the energy deficit further and to avoid our metabolism becoming complacent. Also, don't forget you still need to get your 150 twists done every day to keep your waist coming in as you dispose yourself of the fat."

Around me I'm seeing people fall ill to this deadly illness more frequently and it bothers me deeply. I've had the pleasure of learning from some of the world's most educated scientific brains, such as Dr. Jason Watson. I want to inspire you to think about things you could change in your life to help hedge your and your loved ones' bets against cancer. Reduce sugar intake, filter your water, and avoid reusing plastic bottles. This lifestyle is about being healthy more than it is vanity-never forget that.",

Remember that your heart rate needs to be sticking at around 65-70% of your maximal level for optimized fat burning and to counteract catabolism. Something else to remember this weekend is that as your weight drops down, your macro calculations need to reflect that otherwise you'll be overeating.",

Recovery isn't about not feeling sore; it's about being physically able to outperform your previous best.

        "To start this Sunday off, I hit the mountain trails on my bike, as a means of getting my cardio done. Today I've got a gentleman from Dubai with me, who's flown all this way to spend 4 hours with me! This really blows my mind. I feel very privileged to be in this position where I can have such a positive influence on so many people. Whatever your current situation in life, endeavor to be the best you can be. Do things others won't, so you can have things others can't. There will always be haters and naysayers there to try and defy your persistence, but you just need to ignore that and focus on you. In 5 or 10 years' time, the words these people spout off at you won't matter, so don't listen to them today! Another daily tip you can take from me is taking a bath. Usually I will either start or end my day with a bath because it gives me time to relax, giving my mind the necessary freedom to de-stress. However, it's also a very functional habit for recovery because it helps increase blood flow through your muscle fibers, reducing inflammation and knotting. I thoroughly recommend you make time for this if you can."

It's clear to see from my reflection that I'm getting leaner and I'm also bigger, which explains why the scales aren't moving as quickly now. This is what happens when you commit to your diet plan without any excuse, use the world's best supplements and train like a savage beast.",

        "This week we're using my DTPXtreme principle, which combines high and low reps with short rest periods for maximal penetration within the muscle. This variation of DTP matches the reps and rest periods, so if you get 30 reps, you earn 30 seconds of rest before doing the next set. The goal is to always go as heavy as you can in order to sustain intensity. Remember that each rep range is simply a guide; if you can do more because the weight is too light, DO THEM! If it's too heavy, just rest-pause all the way to the end of the set."

        "Including today, we only have four chest and shoulder workouts left in order to completely evolve the way these muscle groups appear. When I press you will notice there's no locking out and there's a very good reason for that; it makes your chest work harder. If you lock out, all you do is make the triceps take the weight off your pecs, and we need to avoid this! Don't be fooled into thinking shortening the range of motion when pressing makes it easy, just try it! We're sticking with the DTPXtreme principle today, to crush the slow and fast twitch muscle fibers altogether. You've already seen just how brutal this methodology is after yesterday's leg session. Are your legs sore? Make sure you're getting your KAGED MUSCLE supplements in on time, along with your meals and water to recover. I'm amped to smash this workout, so let's not waste any more time!

I'm very instinctive when it comes to choosing my cardio, based on how I feel and where I am. This keeps things interesting for me and allows my mind to remain stimulated, rather than becoming overrun with boredom. The main thing is that you get your cardio done and that you're able to make it part of your lifestyle, through enjoyment. Speaking of lifestyle, today I'm getting my weekly massage and visiting Dr. Watson as I endeavor to keep my body in its highest state of health possible.",

Sticking with this week's theme, there are going to be a lot of reps, short rest intervals and supersets to crush the arms with the DTPXtreme principle. You'll notice that on several of the exercises today I'm using the nylon handle attachments on the bars. In case you're wondering why, they allow me to work with a fuller range of motion, and because of the extra freedom, there's less stress on my wrists and elbows.",

When you're doing my program, it's extremely intense because it makes your body react in an unnatural way, which is exactly what you want!",

        "Can you believe that week 6 is already here? Usually at the start of every week I check-in with a weight update, however, this morning the batteries in my scales died and I have no spare ones in the house! Smart move, Kris. Anyway, I'm going to have to do my weigh-in tomorrow morning on a fasted stomach instead. Remember that keeping the environment exactly the same is imperative when you're tracking weight because this feedback is so important.",
        "I'm just going to check that you've now upped your daily twists to 300 per day, right? These are awesome for helping the skin around your waist stay tight as you shed the fat. While we're on reminders, both your AM and PM cardio sessions now go up to 45 minutes each.",
        "We've got another leg day ahead of us which is going to be a huge one, so make sure you're armed with PRE-KAGED and a mind ready for war, because you'll need it. This week we're sticking with the DTP extreme principle, but this time around we're using more exercises to really take these muscles down! As your body fat comes down you will find this harder, so just keep referring to the program, rest periods and rep ranges as a means of accountability.",

        "As it's gun day, I'm going to throw down some advice for you. Don't just focus on your biceps because they're a mirror muscle; your triceps are pivotal to making your arms grow as they account for almost 70% of your total upper arm size. You always want to create and sustain balance throughout your physique, so antagonist muscle groups have an even share in strength. If there are gross imbalances, then you don't just look silly, you will also increase your chances of injury.",

I've got to get up extra early tomorrow in order to do my cardio then do the same when I land at the other end, which will mean my sleep is going to be cut short. The thing to always remember when it comes to getting your cardio done is that you will try to talk yourself out of doing it now, deferring it until later. Don't do that. As soon as you wake up, just go and do it. Once work is done, go and get it done in the evening. Procrastinating about it will just increase the chances of you missing it which will put you back.",

This way if there are any delays with my flight or stopovers, there's nothing to panic about. This is what I mean when I say control your environment. Don't leave yourself so thinly spread that one small obstacle can derail your progress. The hotel I'm staying at happens to have cooking facilities in my room, but I didn't know that, so I was already prepared.",

This highly potent natural fat burner will also stabilize your blood sugar levels, helping you crush cravings. You require 3 servings per day, and I'd recommend you take them at least 30 minutes before a meal if you're having them at the same time of day to let the ingredients become absorbed.

Your protein intake is going to change to 1.18 g of protein per pound of body weight. As this is \"peak week\" ready for your end photos, the carbohydrate intake is going to fluctuate as follows:",
        "This will help deplete your muscles through the week, so that come Sunday when you carb load, they will soak the glycogen up like a sponge to enhance your overall appearance. You should appear rounder and fuller for your finishing photos. Sure, you're going to be really running on vapors for this final week, but you've come this far so I expect you to make it through from here. Taking PRE-KAGED before your workouts will help sustain better energy levels when the going gets tough.",
        "Today's cardio for me started off with a 5K Color Run, which is a local charitable event. Doing things like this gives you something new to focus on and gives you a reason to do cardio without thinking about it, while raising money for a good cause. It was great noticing this run felt a lot easier than 6 weeks ago, which tells me this program hasn't just made me look better, it's also improved my performance."

If you have the opportunity to get outside and do your cardio, take it; it's always good to breathe fresh air.

There's absolutely no question about it that I'm leaner than ever before and I'm carrying more muscle as well-the mirror doesn't lie.",

Sometimes you need to remain in control of your own mind by doing something which goes against how you feel at that precise moment. Speaking of which, you've been doing well getting all of your cardio done through this intensive transformation. As we're almost at the end, I need to talk to you about tapering it off, rather than just crashing and stopping everything.",
        "You've built your body up to being conditioned to 14 cardio sessions at 55 minutes each now. I'd recommend you drop this to 50 minutes for the first week after your program and only do it for 5 of the days. The next week, cut those 5 sessions down to 45 minutes, to sustain that tapering process.",
        "This will allow your metabolism to adapt more readily without crashing, which could leave you in a vulnerable position to gain weight quickly. Obviously, I want you to keep your diet clean as well; don't go on a binge and start yo-yo dieting! We need to look at reverse dieting so that you gradually rebuild your metabolic rate up. Your protein can remain much the same, but you will want to steadily increase your calories from carbohydrates by around 10-15% per week for the next 6 weeks. You can have a few extra fats as well, but don't mix your carbs and fats together too much.",

        "The final calculations have actually been very eye-opening for a number of reasons, which I'll explain now. The total loss for me is 13 lbs, which in isolation might not appear that drastic. However, the machine that Dr. Watson used to measure my results show that I've actually lost 20.5 lbs of fat and gained over 7 lbs of lean mass, of which 2 lbs is solid muscle tissue. This is almost unheard of, especially in such a short period. Usually gaining 2 lbs of muscle tissue per year is my goal; so to do that in 8 weeks is absolutely phenomenal! This is a testament to my meticulous timing with every meal, the intensity of my workouts and the potency of KAGED MUSCLE supplements.",
        "To further illustrate how amazing these results are, and how life-changing they are, Dr. Watson explained the benefits on my heart. For every pound of body fat you carry, there is approximately 1 mile of capillaries within that tissue which your heart has to pump blood through. That means I've removed 20 miles of blood vessels that my heart had to previously feed with blood, increasing the stress on it, of course. Who knows to what extent this could affect my longevity, as well as yours.",
        "This is why I do these transformations, to show you that this lifestyle is about changing your life for the better. It's so much more than looking great; it's about feeling better within yourself and enhancing your state of health. I'm absolutely thrilled with the results and I'm very pleased that I documented the official stats with a non-biased scientific expert so that you're able to see for yourself how effective this program is.",
        "Such a large part of this process has been about focusing on recovery so that I've always felt refreshed and ready to hit the gym harder than the time before, becoming almost limitless. Having my regular cryotherapy and massage has helped alleviate any previous issues I've had with joint pain and inflammation. The KAGED MUSCLE supplements I've been using, with the patented ingredients and efficacious dosages, have enabled my muscles to recover, then grow like never before. Another intrinsic piece of advice that I need to reiterate is that in order to achieve these kind of results, you must feed your body with the correct nutrients, which it is able to absorb. If you're consuming foods that cause excessive inflammation, then you won't benefit from those nutrients as you should. All of these factors might seem insignificant to you on their own, but once you bring them altogether, you create an overwhelming amount of momentum, as we've done over the last 8 weeks together.",
        "For years I've been told these results are impossible, which is why this time I decided to prove it to you through scientific data. Somebody has to do this stuff and achieve these results, so why can't it be you? I was just a normal guy from a very rural part of Wales, who had very little other than the determination to become someone and inspire millions of people. Your own journey can begin today if you're willing to put this program into action. Don't chat, do!",
        "As a reward to yourself, go and do something that isn't centered on food. Rather than have a big binge out, I've treated myself to some new triathlon gear and I'm also having some of my tattoos touched up. Rewarding yourself with food usually leads to bad eating patterns, so don't go down that route."

        "Your big day is here; everything you've worked for over the last 8 weeks is about to be shown in the photos you take today. There are several steps you must take in order to present your physique in the best possible light, to illustrate your results. This is exactly what I'm doing in order to prepare for my after photos.",
        "Step1: Take 10 g of fermented Citrulline in the morning to help increase your blood flow. This will help dilate your capillaries so that you get a better pump, giving your muscles a fuller look.",
        "Step 2: You must keep your fluids the same as you've done for the duration of this program, along with HYDRA-CHARGE and Creatine HCl. This ensures that you're not going to dehydrate the muscle cells in your body, which would only leave you looking depleted rather than full.",
        "Step 3: Pump up! Choose one exercise per body part (not legs), and do 3 or 4 sets to around 70% of failure. This isn't about killing the muscles now; you're just aiming to get as much blood as you can into your upper body to give the illusion of size, separation and symmetry. Enjoy this process, as this is the final part of the puzzle before you take your photos.",
        "Step 4: Remember to take your extra carbs in today so that you've got the glycogen needed in order to fill out for your photos. You've been depleting all week in preparation for this influx in carbohydrates, so get them in.",
        "Step 5: Take your photos! Take lots of photos from different angles and in different light. However, make sure you've got some which are in the same position/lighting as your before shots. This will give the truest reflection of your progress, which is what you want.",
        "What's Next?",
        "That's you done! We have reached the end and you've got your results to show the world, which I want you to use to inspire a new wave of KAGED MUSCLE® transformees. Don't just stop here, let this become a new way of life by setting new goals. If your new goal is to build muscle now, remember what I said about reverse dieting and tapering your cardio down. Remain in control now that you have gained it and become the best version of you possible! It's been a pleasure doing this transformation together. I'm glad you could make it.",
        "Until next time,."
