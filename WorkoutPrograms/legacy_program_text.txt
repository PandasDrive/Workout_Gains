KRIS GETHIN’S  LEGACY TRAINING PROGRAMIntro
Welcome to the Training Overview of the Legacy Video Trainer. 
Let’s not waste time and get right to the point. We have  
12 weeks to get to work and transform our bodies to be in 
the BEST condition possible. I’ll say it again, eating right and 
following the plan is everything. You CAN’T outtrain a bad 
diet. Period.  
However, you have to build muscle to get the look and 
physique you aspire to. You have to build muscle to burn fat. 
Plus, let’s be honest…it’s the best part of a transformation. 
There is nothing like pushing your physical capabilities, seeing 
progress with your strength, and size in the mirror, and being 
harder to kill. You would be lying to yourself if you didn’t like it. 
Otherwise why do you care to lose weight and potentially still 
look like shit. 
Let me break down just how fast 12 weeks goes.  
You have: 
•   12 Legs & Calves workouts (Monday) 
•   12 Shoulders & Abs workouts (Tuesday) 
•   12 Chest workouts (Wednesday) 
•   12 Back & Calves workouts (Thursday) 
•   12 Arms workouts (Friday) 
That’s it. You CAN’T miss a workout. Non Optional. You 
CAN’T afford to let anything get in between you and the 
training session. These workouts are not for the faint of 
heart. There is no opportunity to “make up” a workout day 
on the weekend, or do two workouts in one day, because 
if you’re following this program precisely as I have outlined, 
your body can’t handle it. Trust me. You won’t recover and 
you will NOT progress. So get your schedule commitments 
and expectations with your loved ones in check. You’re 
committing to me for the next 12 weeks.

KRIS GETHIN’S  LEGACY TRAINING PROGRAMMy Primary Goal for You When 
it Comes to Your Training:
The goal of our training is simple…. We have to put our bodies in 
a depleted state to build muscle and lose fat - we have to create 
trauma, and doing some “unnatural” things in the gym is what will 
give us what are deemed as “unnatural” results outside of it. 
Here is The Workout Split:
Next, let’s break down a few unique 
types of training you’ll be doing:
Y3T:  (Yoda 3 Training)
One of the special training modalites I’ve included in the Legacy 
Training Program is  Y3T (Yoda 3 Training). It was designed by 
my close friend and fellow Welshman Neil Hill who has used 
this training methodology to prepare world class athletes for 
the biggest fitness stage in the world, The Mr. Olympia Contest. 
Athletes such as 7x 212 Mr. Olympia winner Flex Lewis and Open 
Class Mr. Olympia winner, Brandon Curry. 
Y3T is no joke.  It’s an extreme intensity hypertrophy tool that can 
transform a stubborn muscle group into one that’s finely tuned. 
Y3T utilizes high-rep training to optimize hypertrophic response 
for extreme trauma to the muscle in a lower-volume format. We’ll 
be doing Y3T during week 1 and week 2 of the program and then 
week 3 will be DTP . We will then repeat that cycle 3 more times 
over the 12 week period but with different exercises, principle and 
order of movements. • Monday:  Legs and Calves
• Tuesday:  Shoulders and Abs
• Wednesday:  Chest
• Thursday:  Back and Calves• Friday:  Arms
• Saturday:  Active Rest Day
• Sunday:  Active Rest Day

KRIS GETHIN’S  LEGACY TRAINING PROGRAMDTP
The “Dramatic Transformation Principle”, or DTP , is a training 
system that I invented myself and that I’ve used to transform 
countless clients. Literally thousands. DTP engages every 
type of muscle fiber resulting in accelerated sarcoplasmic and 
myofibrillar hypertrophy, which is essential for growth.
The set and rep format of DTP involves a pyramid approach, 
where the number of reps decreases as the weight increases 
and vice versa. Rest intervals should be shorter between  
lighter, high-rep sets and up to 120 seconds between  
heavier, lower rep sets. This ensures optimal performance  
and tempo maintenance.
What is the point of all this volume? When you’re training with 
high reps in a pyramid style progression such as DTP your 
body’s ability to melt fat quickly is amplified. During the workout, 
energy is expended at an alarming rate to sustain performance 
and support recovery. The outcome is accelerated fat  
loss, improved blood sugar management, and better  
insulin sensitivity.
CIRCUITS:
Occasionally we will be hitting circuits for arms. This allows for 
fascia stretching, a shock principle and something that I find 
that works particularly well for biceps and triceps. As an added 
bonus, if you have ever dealt with tennis or gophers elbow, 
or bicep tendonitis, this is a great way to train around these 
inflammatory responders.

KRIS GETHIN’S  LEGACY TRAINING PROGRAMNow Let’s Move on to  
Cardio for This Program: 
Cardio will be in a steady state to keep cortisol low with the goal 
of maintaining or building muscle while burning fat. I would only 
suggest HIIT cardio when we are in a calorie surplus - we are not 
in a calorie surplus on this plan so it will remain as a steady state. 
For cardio. I suggest people do stairmaster as #1 choice. 
•  #2 Elliptical     •  #3 Incline treadmill     •  #4 Cycle 
Now for the first 3 weeks of the program,  you’re only doing 
cardio once per day in the AM. It’s important you do your cardio 
in the morning as I have prescribed, and not when it’s convenient 
for you. Two cardio sessions come later in the program and you 
need your schedule to be in routine. 
•  WK 1: Cardio 20 minutes
•  WK 2:  Cardio 30 minutes
•  WK 3:  Cardio 35 minutes
Once we hit week 4, cardio starts to really pick up in this program. 
•  WK 4:   Cardio 35 minutes AM / 20 minutes PM (do the PM 
cardio outside if you can)
•  WK 5:   Cardio: 35 minutes AM / 35 minutes PM  
(do the PM cardio outside if you can)
Week 6 through 8 we modify even further. 
•   WK 6 - WK 8 Cardio:  45 minutes AM / 35 minutes PM (do the 
PM cardio outside if you can)
And for the remaining 3 weeks of the program. Weeks 9 
through 12 it’s the final push. I know it’s a big commitment, but 
it’s absolutely necessary and not optional. 
•   WK 9-WK 12 Cardio: 45 minutes AM/45 mins PM  
(do the PM cardio outside if you can)
You got this.
